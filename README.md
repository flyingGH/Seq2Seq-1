# Seq2Seq
Caffe implementation of Seq2Seq model for machine translation from English to French
![Alt text](https://people.umass.edu/~jdhaliwal/img/LSTMTrain.jpg "Optional title")
This repository implements a Neural Machine Translation System for translating sentences from English to French. 
The system is built on the principles of the paper [1](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5346-sequence-to-sequence-learning-with-neural-networks.pdf).

Report on system and results [2](https://people.umass.edu/~jdhaliwal/files/s2s.pdf).
